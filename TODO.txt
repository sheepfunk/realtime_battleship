1. Make the move action do stuff

    A. User will click something that will make a call to the move/new action

        - A new move will create a move object
        - Change the turn id of the game
        - Publish a message containing the move location, the move result, and the player id of the mover
        - A test for this?



    B. Most basic proof of concept
        - a move will change who's turn it is, this will get published
